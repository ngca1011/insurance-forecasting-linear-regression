# Introduction
A simple Project of creating a linear regression model to predict Insurance cost based on age, sex, bmi, number of children, smoke or not and regilion

# Implementation steps 

1. Read data from a csv file
2. Check for missing values in dataset and fill the values if they are missing
3. Removing dummy variables trap
4. Split dataset into 20% of training data and 80% of test data
5. Build a model using the linear regression equation

7. Test the model, evaluate the Model by calculating the R Square value (the coefficient of determination) and MSE

# Update

Added an implementation with tensorflow for a simple neural network
